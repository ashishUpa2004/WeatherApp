# WeatherApp for Android

A simple Android application that displays current weather information for a specified city using a free weather API. 
This project demonstrates the use of modern Android development practices including Jetpack Compose for UI, Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations, ViewModel for UI-related data, and Retrofit for networking.
